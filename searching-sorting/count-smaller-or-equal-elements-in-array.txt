given 2 array of int. let's call the first array A and 2nd array 
B. a finds the number of elements in array that are smaller 
than or equal to that element for every array element

example A = [2, 3, 0] and B = [5,1]
  for A[0] = 2
  in array B only 1 is less thn 2, therefore the
   answer for the first index is 1.

   for A[1] = 3
  in array B only 1 is less thn 3, therefore the
   answer for the first index is also 1.

   for A[2] = 0
  both element of array B  are greater than 0. therefore the
   answer for the first index is 0.

   hence , final answer is [1,1,0] in this case.

STEPWISE ILLUSTRATION

 

Dry Run :

arr1 = [5,3,1] , arr2 = [3,4]

 

Apply Binary Search On Arr2 and Search Element of First Arr1 As a Target Element
 

Where 5 is target element

 

low = 0; high = 1; cnt = 0;

 

Iteration 1 :

 while(0<=1) True 

mid = (0+1)/2 = 0 

if(arr2[mid] <= target) 

cnt=mid+1 

low=mid+1 

else 

high = mid-1 

if(3<=5) True 

cnt = 0+1 = 1 

low = 0+1 = 1

 

After Iteration 1 We Got Low = 1,High = 1,Cnt = 1

 

Iteration 2 :

low = 1 high = 1 cnt = 1 

while(1<=1) True 

mid = (1+1)/2 = 1 

if(4<=5) True 

cnt = 1+1 = 2 

low = 1+1 = 2

 

After Iteration 2 We Got Low = 2,High = 1,Cnt = 2

 

Iteration 3 : low = 2 high = 1 cnt = 1 

while(2<=1) False 

Terminate Loop Then return Cnt;

 

After Iteration 3 We Got Final Ans Cnt = 2

 

Apply Same Process For arr1 to For all element
